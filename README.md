# React + Vite

## Getting Started

- NOTE: The API endpoints use are in render. On the first attempt it will 'wake' the server, which can delay requests by 50 seconds or more. Try several times some times it takes longer.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i

npm run dev
```

https://render.com/


## Env File:
```bash
VITE_CLIENT_URL=https://demo-serv-8jjh.onrender.com
```
